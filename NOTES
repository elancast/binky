What needs to happen:
-listener on body for key presses
  -ignore keypresses on anyhting that could take input -- i.e, the search box
-parse for the different results to iterate over...(maybe do this every time
 there's a key press so handle changes? -- depends on speed)
-inject an element to indicate focus
  -could make background of focused result be a different color
  -put star next to focus
